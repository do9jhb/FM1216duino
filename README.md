FM1216-Library is a library to control FM1216-Tuners with an Arduino.
You can configure the pins, where the Tuner is connected, in FM1216.h with SDA_PORT,SDA_PIN and SCL_PORT,SCL_PIN. Default are SDA: PORTC4 and SCL: PORTC5. These are the default pins on Arduinos with Mega328 (Uno, Nano).
Also you can configure there the Adresses for the Tuner. Default adresses are for a Tuner with AS connected to ground.
